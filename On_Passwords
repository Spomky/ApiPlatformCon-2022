Hello Spomky!

Passwords connect web applications and users.

1. Web applications cannot identify the person as typing the user's password has nothing to do with the person.
2. Users (adult persons) are not able to handle (generate, store, change) passwords.

So password authentication is a **failed technology**.
Please remember that originally a soldier stood beside each computer. There was no authentication in the software.
